# Tokenized Invoice Factoring Platform

A blockchain-based solution that transforms traditional invoice factoring into a transparent, efficient, and accessible digital marketplace for businesses, investors, and financial institutions.

## Overview

The Tokenized Invoice Factoring Platform revolutionizes how businesses access working capital by converting accounts receivable into tradable digital assets. By leveraging blockchain technology, this platform creates a secure, transparent marketplace where businesses can obtain immediate funding against outstanding invoices while investors gain access to a new class of short-term, yield-generating assets backed by real-world receivables.

## Key Components

### Invoice Verification Contract

The Invoice Verification Contract establishes the authenticity and validity of invoices submitted to the platform.

- Validates invoice legitimacy through multi-party attestation
- Verifies invoice details against purchase orders and delivery confirmations
- Implements duplicate detection to prevent double financing
- Records proof of invoice existence and ownership
- Integrates with existing accounting systems for data validation
- Maintains cryptographic proofs of verification processes
- Provides audit trails for compliance and dispute resolution

### Credit Assessment Contract

The Credit Assessment Contract evaluates the risk profile and payment probability of tokenized invoices.

- Analyzes historical payment data of invoice payers
- Implements algorithmic risk scoring models
- Aggregates third-party credit rating information
- Calculates probability of payment and expected settlement timeframes
- Determines appropriate discount rates based on risk profiles
- Monitors ongoing credit status of participating entities
- Provides transparent risk metrics to potential investors

### Tokenization Contract

The Tokenization Contract transforms verified invoices into tradable digital assets on the blockchain.

- Creates unique non-fungible tokens (NFTs) representing invoice ownership
- Implements ERC-20 compliant fungible tokens for fractional ownership
- Manages invoice metadata and supporting documentation
- Establishes pricing models based on credit assessment
- Supports primary issuance and secondary market trading
- Implements regulatory compliance checks for token transfers
- Provides liquidity pool mechanisms for efficient price discovery

### Payment Distribution Contract

The Payment Distribution Contract manages the collection and disbursement of funds when invoices are paid.

- Monitors incoming payments from invoice payers
- Automatically distributes funds to token holders based on ownership
- Handles partial payments and payment schedules
- Manages escrow for disputed invoices
- Implements waterfall payment structures for tranched investments
- Calculates and distributes platform fees
- Provides detailed payment reconciliation records
